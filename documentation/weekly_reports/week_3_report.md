# Week 3

Time used: 4 + 6 = x hours.

## What have you done this week?

Wednesday: I made some debugging and tests for Dijkstra. Finally, all the tests ran successfully and the algorithm finds the shortest path. Tomorrow, I'll be focusing on improving the GUI, so that I can actually see the algorithm working more visual way. 

Thursday: I managed to made workable GUI with drawing element and picking up the coordinates that user clicks. I saw, that my algorithm was making some sort of tik-tak-toe, but then I realized, that I can't move same distance straightforward and diagonally. I explored the web, and made distances 1 and 1.4, and now I can actually see that the Dijkstra is working! Tomorrow I'll start implementing the A* to the program and write more tests. I have also a couple of odd errors, that I'll be looking into. 

Friday: XX

## How has the project progressed?

Project has been made a great leaps at this week. The core functionality is now a workable program. Now I can put all my focus on building the data structures and creating the A* and JPS. GUI can be made better, if there is more time.

## What did you learn this week / today?

I have learned a lot about Dijkstra. I also made comprehensive tests for Dijkstra, that helped me to fix it workable from last week. It went more easily that I thought.  

## What has been inclear or problematic? 

On this week, almost everything went quite smoothly. 

## What next?
