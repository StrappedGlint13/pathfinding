# Week 3

Time used: 4 + 6 + 7 = 19 hours.

## What have you done this week?

Wednesday: I made some debugging and tests for Dijkstra. Finally, all the tests ran successfully and the algorithm finds the shortest path. Tomorrow, I'll be focusing on improving the GUI, so that I can actually see the algorithm working more visual way. 

Thursday: I managed to made workable GUI with drawing element and picking up the coordinates that user clicks. I saw, that my algorithm was making some sort of tik-tak-toe, but then I realized, that I can't move same distance straightforward and diagonally. I explored the web, and made distances 1 and 1.4, and now I can actually see that the Dijkstra is working! Tomorrow I'll start implementing the A* to the program and write more tests. I have also a couple of odd errors, that I'll be looking into. 

Friday: I implemented A* to the program. I also made path line for A* as well. I made comparsion to the command prompt. 

## How has the project progressed?

Project has been made a great leaps at this week. The core functionality is now a workable program. Now I can put all my focus on building the data structures and creating the A* and JPS. GUI can be made better, if there is more time.

## What did you learn this week / today?

I have learned a lot about Dijkstra. I also made comprehensive tests for Dijkstra, that helped me to fix it workable from last week. It went more easily that I thought.  

## What has been inclear or problematic? 

On this week, almost everything went quite smoothly. Next week I think I'll have challenge on creating own data structures with priorityqueue and binaryheap.

I'm still having troubles with the loaded Images from the benchmark website. It seems that every uploaded photo is 1073x1073 pixels.. 

## What next?

Next week I'll start by finnishing heuristics correctly to the A*. Main thing is to create own data structures starting with the priorityqueue. Looking forward to it. If I have time, I'll set another Scene for comparsion of the algorithms.
