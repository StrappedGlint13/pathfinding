# Week 5

Time used: 8 + 6 + 8 = 22 hours.

## What have you done this week?

Monday: I continued testing the heap, and finally got it working right. I also implemented it to A*. 

Tuesday: I replaced Java Utils library _ArrayList_ with my _List_ -class. Now the algorithms are not using any external libraries. In addition, I improved the GUI and added all the visited vertices to the screen. This I will implement later to the program.  

Thursday: I made some tests and javadocs for the data structures. Also made some documentation and read a bit about JPS. 

Friday: I started with JPS. 

## How has the project progressed?
 
This week was very productive. I made a List-class and replaced from the algorithms and data-structures. In addition I started making JPS, mainly focusing on movement.

## What did you learn this week / today?

I have learned a lot about Jump Point Search -algorithm. I also try to make this algorithm so tiny steps as possible. I think I have learned very good test-driven -mentality. 
 
## What has been inclear or problematic? 

This week everything went quite smoothly. Replacing ArrayList was much more easier than I thought. 

Maybe some tips or reading suggestions to JPS could be useful. 

## What next?

I'll continue with developing JPS, next step is to handle the neighbours. This week went mostly with the programming part, so I will focus more to documentation (these I progressed every week a little, so this should not be a big job). Also I will make more complex tests to the algorithms.
