# Week 5

Time used: 8 + 6 + 6 = 20 hours.

## What have you done this week?

Monday: I continued testing the heap, and finally got it working right. I also implemented it to A*. 

Tuesday: I replaced Java Utils library _ArrayList_ with my _List_ -class. Now the algorithms are not using any external libraries. In addition, I improved the GUI and added all the visited vertices to the screen. This I will implement later to the program.  

Thursday: I made some tests and javadocs for the data structures. Also made some documentation and read a bit about JPS.
