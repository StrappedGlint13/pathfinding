# Week 3

Time used: 8 + 6 + 8 =  hours.

## What have you done this week?

Wednesday: I got A* and Dijkstra working correctly – both finding the same path with same amount of nodes and every unit test passing. Made a couple methods and add-function to the heap. 

Thursday: I completed the heap with unit test passing. I started to change heap to the java version, but there seem to be some problems – Dijkstra is finding sometimes a couple of steps longer path. I'll look into that,

Friday: 

## How has the project progressed?
