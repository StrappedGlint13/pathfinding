# Week 1

Time used: 8 hours.

## What have you done this week?

This week went mainly choosing the topic for the project, planning and reading things for the project. I am very excited about the pathing algorithms that I chose.  

## How has the project progressed?

Mostly, I have read information about the pathing algorithms and iterating things for the subject (nets, shortest path algorithms, priority queue etc.). I also documented spesification for the project and have some sort of idea of coding the user interface. 

## What did you learn this week / today?

I have learned more about the shortest path algorithms and how they differ. A* and Jump Point Search algorithms are totally new for me. I made also quick review of the 2D grid maps and how to handle these as a net. 

## What has been inclear or problematic? 

So far everything has been quite clear to me. Next week, when the actual coding starts I assume that there will be plenty of challenge and problematic situations. Still looking forward to it. 

## What next?

Next week I'll start working with the actual thing. I will implement raw versions of the algorithms to the program starting with the Dijkstra and moving along. Preliminary user interface should be also implemented. I had something in my mind like follows:

- Download the map from [2D Pahtfinding Benchmarks](https://www.movingai.com/benchmarks/grids.html)
- Open the program
- Choose the map
- Go through every nodes, draw the best path with different colour on it = good visualization
- Run every algorithms with different colours and give times to find the path
