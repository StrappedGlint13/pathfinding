# Week 3

Time used: 1 + 8 + hours.

## What have you done this week?

Wednesday: Read a bit about heuristics and A*. 

Thursday: I changed the heuristic of A* to Euclidean distance, because Manhattan distance can be only used when moving "straight". I managed to get A* to find the shortest path with heuristic (same as Dijkstra), but there seem to be a problem with efficienty. The A* is slower currently, this should be fixed. 

Friday:

## How has the project progressed?

I have implemented the correct heuristics to the A*. Altought, not sure if it's correctly working. Both algorithm A* and Dijkstra handles the same amount of vertices every time, but when I am looking the map, it's still confusing. 

A* is working faster than Dijkstra in most of the cases. If the feed is bigger (longer distance between the start and the end), Dijkstra is working faster, especially with the labyrinth maps.
