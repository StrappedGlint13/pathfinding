# Week 3

Time used: 8 + hours.

## What have you done this week?

Wednesday: I changed the heuristic of A* to Euclidean distance, because Manhattan distance can be only used when moving "straight". I managed to get A* to find the shortest path with heuristic (same as Dijkstra), but there seem to be a problem with efficienty. The A* is slower currently, this should be fixed.
