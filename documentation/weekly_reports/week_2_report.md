# Week 1

Time used: 3 + 5 + 4 + 

## What have you done this week?

Tuesday: I finished configurations with GitHub actions and implemented checkstyle and testing to the project and to the CI-pipeline of the project. 

Wednesday: Todays topic was to create a simple user interface, thus I made a UI, where user can give a link to the PNG-picture (assumption that the user is using 2D maps). Then the 2D map will appear shortly. I also cutted image to 2D pixel-map, where I will handle the pixels (grids) as nodes.

Thursday: I started implementing Dijkstra's algorithm to the program. I also made utils like Vertice and Edge for making a net from pixels. 

## How has the project progressed?




## What did you learn this week / today?


## What has been inclear or problematic? 

I had a little problems with checkstyle but finally build worked. I am wondering what are suitable checkstyle conditions for the project, that's why the current conditions might be messy a bit. 


## What next?

Next week I'll start working with the actual thing.
